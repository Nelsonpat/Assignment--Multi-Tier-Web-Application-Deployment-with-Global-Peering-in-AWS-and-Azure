**Multi-Tier Web Application Deployment with Global Peering in AWS and Azure**  

**Problem Statement**:  

As organizations expand their digital footprint, deploying web applications in a multi-tier architecture across multiple cloud providers becomes crucial. This project focuses on deploying a web application in a multi-tier architecture on both AWS and Azure, and configuring global peering to establish seamless communication between the two environments. The objective is to gain proficiency in multi-cloud deployment, networking, and global connectivity.  

**Objectives:  
**•    Deploy a multi-tier web application on AWS and Azure.  
•    Configure networking components for each tier, including VPCs, subnets, and security groups.  
•    Establish global peering between the AWS and Azure environments for seamless communication.  
•    Enhance skills in multi-cloud architecture, networking, and peering configurations.  

**Deliverables  
**•    Deployed Multi-Tier Web Application: A functional web application deployed on both AWS and Azure.  
•    Networking Configurations: Configured VPCs, subnets, and security groups for each tier on both cloud providers.  
•    Global Peering Setup: Established global peering connections between the AWS and Azure environments.  
•    Documentation: Detailed documentation covering the entire deployment process, networking configurations, and global peering setup.  

**Timeline**  
•    48 hrs  

**Tasks/Activities List**  

1. AWS Deployment:  
   •    Design the multi-tier architecture, including web, application, and database tiers.  
   •    Deploy the web application on AWS using services like EC2, RDS, and S3.  
   •    Configure security groups, subnets, and other networking components.  

2. Azure Deployment:  
   •    Design a parallel multi-tier architecture on Azure using services like VMs, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Storage.  
   •    Deploy the web application on Azure with appropriate configurations.  
   •    Ensure consistency with the AWS deployment in terms of functionality and architecture.  

3. Networking Configurations:  
   •    Configure Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) on both AWS and Azure.  
   •    Set up subnets for each tier within the VPCs.  
   •    Implement security groups and network access controls to ensure secure communication within each environment.  

4. Global Peering Setup:  
   •    Establish global peering connections between the AWS and Azure VPCs.  
   •    Configure route tables to enable seamless communication between the multi-tier architectures.  
   •    Test and validate the global peering setup to ensure connectivity between the two cloud environments.  

5. Documentation and Report Compilation:  
   •    Document the deployment process for both AWS and Azure, including services used and configurations.  
   •    Provide detailed information on the networking configurations for each tier.  
   •    Describe the steps taken to establish global peering connections.  
   •    Include diagrams and illustrations to enhance clarity.  
   •    Compile all documentation into a comprehensive report.  

6. Troubleshooting and Common Issues:  
   •    Identify potential issues during AWS and Azure deployment.  
   •    Develop troubleshooting guidelines for common multi-cloud deployment challenges.  
   •    Address issues related to networking configurations and global peering, providing solutions.  

**Bonus Points**  
•    Implement load balancing solutions on both AWS and Azure for enhanced performance.  
•    Explore advanced networking features like VPC peering within the same cloud provider.  

**Submission Process**  
•    Submit the comprehensive report along with relevant documentation and any code or scripts used.
